# Personal Kanban Board
<h2><b>Description</h2></b>
<p>This is a basic Kanban Board that I created as a final project for my CS50x Intro to Computer Science course through Harvard. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to do this, as I thought that was the easiest way to do so and these are the languages that I feel the most comfortable with. Much of the work was fairly straightforward since all a kanban board is is a board for tracking progress on tasks. I've struggled with very severe ADHD all my life, so kanban boards are something that have always helped me to keep track of progress and stay consistent with personal projects. It's that helpfulness that drove me to create one of my own for this project.</p> 

<p>I created the board itself and gave it the usual sections one would find on any kanban board: <b>To Do</b>, <b>In Progress</b>, <b>Done</b> and <b>Blocked</b>. Then I separated those into sections with HTML, colored them and created sample tasks. I added some code to allow the user to drag and drop tasks into the different sections as well as a button to create a new task. The form for creating a new task wasn't so hard to make in HTML, as it was basically the same thing as creating a contact form on a website so I followed the steps to do that. The trickier part came when getting the function for saving new tasks to work.</p>

<h2><b>Further Plans</h2></b>
<p>Currently, the board is lacking in a few features. If I were to continue working on it, I'd love to add a way to create multiple boards (each for their own projects) similar to something like Trello. I'd also loveto get some more front end practice in at some point and really pretty the board up since it looks quite plain in its current state.</p>
