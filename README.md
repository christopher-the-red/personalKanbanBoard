# Personal Kanban Board
## Description
<p>This is a basic Kanban Board that I created as a final project for my CS50x Intro to Computer Science course through Harvard. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to do this, as I thought that was the easiest way to do so and these are the languages that I feel the most comfortable with. Much of the work was fairly straightforward since all a kanban board is is a board for tracking progress on tasks. I've struggled with very severe ADHD all my life, so kanban boards are something that have always helped me to keep track of progress and stay consistent with personal projects. It's that helpfulness that drove me to create one of my own for this project.</p> 

<p>I created the board itself and gave it the usual sections one would find on any kanban board: <b>To Do</b>, <b>In Progress</b>, <b>Done</b> and <b>Blocked</b>. Then I separated those into sections with HTML, colored them and created sample tasks. I added some code to allow the user to drag and drop tasks into the different sections as well as a button to create a new task. To do this, I learned how to open up an overlay that takes user input after pressing the "+New Task" button I created. I also allow the user to edit the example tasks AND their newly created tasks as they see fit.</p>

## Additional Learnings
I came into this project with a decent enough level of knowledge of HTML and a bit less of CSS and Javascript, all of which were supplemented by what we had covered in CS50. For this project, I had learned how to create overlays and separate panels in order to create new tasks. I also learned several more of the different values and units within CSS to make things a bit prettier on the front end.

## Further Plans
<p>Currently, the board is lacking in a few features. If I were to continue working on it, I'd love to add a way to create multiple boards (each for their own projects) similar to something like Trello. I'd also love to get some more front end practice in at some point and really pretty the board up since it looks quite plain in its current state. Further than that, were I to continue with this project, I would also like to give the user te ability to add descriptions and steps to tasks and for the user to be able to save their board since it resets with each run in its current state.</p>
